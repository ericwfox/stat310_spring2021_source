## Exercise 1
```{r}
sum(1:1000)
```

## Exercise 2
```{r}
seq(3, 60, by = 3)
```

## Exercise 3
```{r}
min(mtcars$wt)
max(mtcars$wt)
mean(mtcars$wt)
median(mtcars$wt)
```
Or you can use `summary()` to compute all these at once:
```{r}
summary(mtcars$wt)
```

\newpage

## Exercise 4
There is a negative association between the number of cylinders and miles per gallon (mpg).  As the number of cylinders increases, the mpg of the car decreases.
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg, xlab="Number of cylinders", ylab="Miles per gallon")
```

## Exericse 5
The Lotus Europa has the minimum weight.  The Lincoln Continental has the maximum weight.
```{r}
mtcars[which.min(mtcars$wt), ]
mtcars[which.max(mtcars$wt), ]
```
